## Project Description

Crypto Savvy is a browser-based decentralized finance (DeFi) application that provides users with a seamless and secure platform to conduct Ethereum transactions. This application is designed to integrate effortlessly with the Metamask wallet, enabling users to authenticate and manage transactions within the DeFi ecosystem directly through their browser.

### Key Features:
- **Metamask Integration**: The application integrates with Metamask, allowing users to connect their wallet for easy access and management of Ethereum transactions.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Users can interact with the Ethereum blockchain, specifically on the Sepolia testnet, to perform various transactions, including sending and viewing Ethereum transfers.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: The application utilizes the `hardhat` development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, written in Solidity. The smart contracts support functionalities such as adding transactions to the blockchain, retrieving the transaction count, and fetching all transactions.
- **Transactions Management**: Users can view and track their Ethereum transactions in a dynamic and user-friendly interface. Each transaction is displayed with a Giph generated based on a keyword entered by the user. The system also provides detailed information about each transaction, including the amount, timestamp, sender and receiver addresses, and a direct link to the transaction details on Etherscan.
